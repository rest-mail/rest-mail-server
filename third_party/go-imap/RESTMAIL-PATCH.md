# Import flag compatibility patch

This is go-imap v0.13.2, retained with its original tests and license, plus the
minimal interfaces and protocol changes needed to preserve imported keywords
and seed the engine's existing Deleted set from stored messages. A local module
replacement makes the server build reproducibly until these changes can move
upstream. No installed module cache is modified.

Import permits at most 100 distinct case-insensitive keywords per message,
255 ASCII bytes each, and five system flags. Keywords use RFC 3501 atom syntax
and cannot contain a backslash. FLAGS reports existing mailbox keywords; PERMANENTFLAGS also advertises `\*`.
Keyword STORE is included only because imapsync filters out keywords before
APPEND unless this wildcard is advertised, and RFC 3501 requires the advertised
capability to work. The same syntax, count and length bounds apply to STORE.

## RFC 3501 corrections

These change protocol behaviour from go-imap v0.13.2, and each corrects a defect
found by the RFC 3501 inventory in rest-mail/rest-mail-server#374.

- A SELECT or EXAMINE refused with BAD no longer drops the selected mailbox,
  because "a rejected command (BAD response) never changes the state of the
  connection or of the selected mailbox" (RFC 3501 §6). That holds both for a
  parse failure in `handleSelect` and for a refusal while the command line and
  its literals are read in `Handle`. A failed selection, answered NO, still
  deselects. `TestSelectionInvalidArguments` asserted the old deselection, so
  it is corrected rather than retained as it was upstream.
